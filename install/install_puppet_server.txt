Quick Start
Enable the Puppet package repositories, if you haven’t already done so.
Stop the existing Puppet master service. The method for doing this varies depending on how your system is set up.

If you’re running a WEBrick Puppet master, use: service puppetmaster stop.

If you’re running Puppet under Apache, you’ll instead need to disable the puppetmaster vhost and restart the Apache service. The exact method for this depends on what your Puppet master vhost file is called and how you enabled it. For full documentation, see the Passenger guide.

On a Debian system, the command might be something like sudo a2dissite puppetmaster.
On RHEL/CentOS systems, the command might be something like sudo mv /etc/httpd/conf.d/puppetmaster.conf ~/. Alternatively, you can delete the file instead of moving it.

After you’ve disabled the vhost, restart Apache, which is a service called either httpd or apache2, depending on your OS.

Alternatively, if you don’t need to keep the Apache service running, you can stop Apache with service httpd stop or service apache2 stop.

Install the Puppet Server package by running:

 yum install puppetserver
Or

 apt-get install puppetserver
Note that there is no - in the package name.

Start the Puppet Server service:

 systemctl start puppetserver
Or

 service puppetserver start

Platforms without Packages

For platforms where no official packages are available, you can build Puppet Server from source. Such platforms are not tested, and running Puppet Server from source is not recommended for production use.

For details, see Running from Source.

Memory Allocation
By default, Puppet Server is configured to use 2GB of RAM. However, if you want to experiment with Puppet Server on a VM, you can safely allocate as little as 512MB of memory. To change the Puppet Server memory allocation, you can edit the init config file.

Location
/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver — RHEL
/etc/default/puppetserver — Debian
Open the init config file:

 # Modify this if you'd like to change the memory allocation, enable JMX, etc
 JAVA_ARGS="-Xms2g -Xmx2g"
Replace 2g with the amount of memory you want to allocate to Puppet Server. For example, to allocate 1GB of memory, use JAVA_ARGS="-Xms1g -Xmx1g"; for 512MB, use JAVA_ARGS="-Xms512m -Xmx512m".

For more information about the recommended settings for the JVM, see Oracle’s docs on JVM tuning.

Restart the puppetserver service after making any changes to this file.
